This is to be an atheist resorce site with links to blogs, podcasts, wiki, articles, what's going on, atheist comminities near you. 
The idea is to create a place that links to all the info you could need on atheism, deconverting, and so on instead of having to tell people to go 
to a bunch of different places it could be one hub to take you to all of them. If money is made I want to donate to a most voted on charity.
- operating costs (this includes you if you help), if it goes anywhere. I know for me there's been a lot of times I've had to send 
people to numerous spots to look stuff up.I got the idea while going to an seo conference and the site datingadvice.com and I really 
liked how their site brought everything together

Any help you can give of time to help build would be greatly appritiated and credited on the site for your help. I've already bought the domain name and have hosting already.
I am a jr programmer with only a year of coding down but I am passionate about the skeptical movement. Thanks for reading and I hope to see 
some pull requests.
